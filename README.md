# Design-and-perform-Analysis-of-Full-Adder-Using-FinFET-Technique
In recent years, modern VLSI area-efficient devices are most used due to most of the devices becoming portable. The FinFET technique is often employed in designing low-power, area-efficient, and high-speed devices. The one-bit full adder circuit using CMOS-based logic and domino-based logic on Cadence Virtuoso 6. 1. 7 has been designed based on 180nm technology with the supply voltage of 3V. This work evaluates the performance of CMOS and Domino logic based on the full adder circuit in terms of delay and power consumption. It was found that Domino logic-based one-bit full adder circuit occupied lesser area and delay as a comparison to one-bit full adder circuit based on CMOS logic. The FinFET technology is a present trend in the low power circuits designing as it comprises less delay and power consumption than CMOS or domino-based logic and has been designed based on 18nm Finfet technology. The output response was verified by comparing the obtained waveform along with its truth table. Cadence output simulation matches will the Full Adder with theoretical expectations.
